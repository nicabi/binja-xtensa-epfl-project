# Notes

- gcc has a xtensa  firmware plugin to create test codde
- espressif is a good starfting point, older cpu fr extensa, starting point of bin ninja
- focus on improving the python implemntation, as a full rewrite might be tedious and hard to debug.

- most community plugins are written in python, so probably good to assume it is possible to achieve decent performance without the need of rewritting
